2. Pros & cons of each
3. Add to business plan
4. Storefronts and traditional offices are not necessary right now!

			1. Google voice ties it to your city

### Page by Page: portfolio & TODO ###
1. Portfolio:

2. Your portfolio exhibits proven capabilities
3. User personal projects as placeholders for now
4. **Always add context - why does this project matter?**
	1. A narrative, a story
		1. Using PAR statement: Problem, Action, Result
			1. Example: 
				1. Challenge: "'We have a tech talen shortage' is a common cry among the media, the government, the private sector, and often, the tech sector itself. I wanted to construct a site highlighting up-and-coming devs who are living, working proof that this is a false narrative"
				2. Solution: "The Dev Spotlight is an interactive space that pays homage to the original 'net. Featuring a JQuery-based terminal simulator as a navigation bar for "superusers", the site also remains accessible to non-techies with a simple, clearly defined clickable photo gallery along with a clickable About tab."
					1. Technical implementation details: Skeleton CSS on each dev profile ensures 100% responsive design. I also incorporated colors to reduce eye strain, such as aliceblue instead of white, and a medium gray to replace black text. Finally, I optimized the landing page for mobile users by removing the terminal.
				3. Outcome: "The Dev Spotlight Series is an avant garde take on design, with progressive enhancement for maximum UX/UI. These developers now have a home that is hip, interactive, and 100% responsive"
				4. Plus Link
5. TODO:
	1. Problem Action Result

			1. Own projects
			2. Client projects
