## MVP - Kauffman School ##
1. MVP - Test peices of the product incrementaly and iteratively
	1. Questions to answer:
		1. What do I test?
		2. Why do I test it?
		3. How do I know what time to test it at?
		4. Is the problem shared by anybody other than me?
			1. Ways to find out:
				1. A website saying "If you have this problem, click here"
				2. One or one interview to know if people share the problem
		5. Does the class of solutions we are building solve the problem?
			1. Does the solution in general (not specific product) solve the problem we have validated?
				1. Examples: A website that did x, would that be exciting and interesting to you to pay for it?
					1. What if there is a physical device that did x or y?
				2. Use the following instead of verbal descriptions:
					1. Mockups
					2. Wireframes
					3. Clay prototypes
	2. MVP doesn't need to be bug free and complete
		1. We are not building a product but we're getting customer feedback
			1. Use powerpoint slides say instead of code (if it can be done)
				1. Avoid a lot of engineering if we don't know if it is right
					1. Until we have something repeatable: People are saying over and over again "yes we need this . Finish it and we want to buy it"
		2. Use MVPs to run experiments
			1. **Before we take MVPs for testing, we need to have a series of hypothesis we want to test**
				1. Write down **what do we expect to happen in the experiement**
					1. Example: 45% of people might raise their hand and give me a check
						2. Then test it. If no one was willing to buy, then it is data that saved 6 months of development say
				2. Use the test data to modify the hypothesis
		3. Don't pre-plan all the development activity of finished product from MVP in the beginning (architecture, design, features, ...)
			1. Don't try to Engineer in the beginning without any feedback that it needs that kind of Engineering
