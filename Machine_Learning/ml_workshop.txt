data drift

publishing model:
model is accessible through API endpoint

Assessing model:
   feed live data - payload
      model is scored
	  
openscale:
    config: IBM AI openscale library
	persistance: PostgreSQL is provided
	   used by openscale for persistance

Bind WML to openscale
    subscription
	probablility: that the output is right
	
fairness config:
    ...
    majority
	minority
	threshold
	min records - used to detect fairness (100-200...)

Run fairness monitor

fairness monitoring:
    1. openscale will construct purturbed data
	2. bias graph: below threshold is not acceptable - above threshold is good performance
