				1. Best known always beats the others
	4. If we become a brand, we can demand the price
		1. We can make profit on every sale we make
	5. Solutions:
		1. PRs (?)
			1. PR: Public Relations
				1. Set of techniques and strategies related to managing how information about an individual or company is disseminated to the public, and expecially the media
				2. PR in Business:
					1. It is a valuable tool in promotional mix (?)
					2. It is focused on earned media and takes benefit from unpaid communication channels
					3. **It is about managing preceptions** - how people think about your business
				3. How to do it?

	6. Constancy and Consistency is required for
		1. People will notice
	7. **Start becoming a brand every month**
2. Keep a stop loss everyday (bottom-line)
	1. Every deal, sale, every product
	2. What is stop-loss? (helps safe-guard against losing profitability)
		1. Stop loss when getting into negotiations with each and every 
			1. Customers
			2. Vendors
			3. Suppliers
			4. ...
		2. We will have a price point for everything
			1. Bare minimum level
				1. It must include certain profitability and we must never go below that
					1. Customer must realize that this person will not go below this (they start giving)
						1. They know they are paying for quality work
				2. If we go below this, it stops making business sence to operate
					1. It may not make commercial sense
	3. We are also setting a trend in the market (a mindset for the customer as well)
		1. We will not deal below that price
	4. The lowest price I keep will become the benchmark (don't go below this point)
	5. Don't allow anyone to arm-twist
3. Diversify our products and services
	1. **Profitability takes a hit if we are offering a single service or product in the market or just a few**
		1. It is a single point of failure
			1. Say
				1. Raw material prices go up
				2. Competition is coming up
				3. ...
			2. The above might impact the profitability
	2. If we have different products and services, it will not impact the profitability so much
		1. Risk is mitigated & divided
			1. Gives more time to come up with more products, services, reduces percentage of sale of that product, ...
	3. Look at more and more offerings of products and services either in the same market or new market ...
		1. Helps diversify revenue streams (more than one revenue streams)
		2. Helps hedge against any fluctuations & external changes
			1. Stops affecting profitability
	4. **Do it when you don't need it**
		1. Important vs Critical
			1. Important - long term
				1. Do it immediately
		2. No time for strategic thinking if we keep firefighting on our own (build a team to do it)
			1. Don't be employed in our own business (worst thing)
4. Constructing MIS to Track Profitability (?)
	1. MIS?
		1. Management Information Systems:
			1. Study of people, technology, organizations, and relationships among them
		2. Examples of MIS:
			1. E-Commerce Business:
				1. Payroll processing
				2. Order processing
				3. Invoicing
		3. MSS:
			1. Management Support Systems:
				1. They store and organize data
					2. They enable end users to generate reports and analyze data to address business needs and inform planning
		4. What is it used for?
			1. Decision making
			2. Coordination
			3. Control
			4. Analysis
			5. Visualization of information in an organization
	2. No report then no result
		1. Whatever we want to measure then start measuring it
		2. **Whatever will not be measured will not be achieved**
	3. Different MISs are required to track profitability
		1. Need clarity on profitability
	4. **Work on reports, systems and processes** - they must indicate by-monthly, weekly, monthly, ... where we have gone
		1. Helps us with ideas on what to change (to steer the business early on) with
			1. Product portfolio
			2. Product mix
			3. Sales funnels
			4. Branding
		2. Work on all of the above
	5. Get financial reports monthly, by-weekly or monthly basis
		1. Get very good understanding of cach flow
		2. Get very good understanding of expenses
		3. Get extremely good understanding of margins, products and services
		4. Have clear goal of gross and net profits (?) (day in an day out)
			1. Net profits: Amount of money we are left with after having paid all our allowable business expenses
				1. Net profit = gross profit - operating expenses - interest - taxes
					1. If Net profit < 0 => Net loss
				2. Why calculate Net Profit?
					1. It determines financial health of the business
						1. **Tells if business is making more than what it is spending**
				3. How does it help?
					1. Helps decide when & how to expand the business
					2. Helps when to reduce expenses
			2. gross profits: Amount of money we are left with after deducting costs of goods sold from revenue
				1. We need to calculate gross profits to arrive at net profits
				2. It is profit a business makes after subtracting all costs related to manufacturing & selling its products/services
					1. Gross profit = total sales - cost of goods sold (COGS)
					2. Total sales = goods sold over financial period (exclude sales of fixed assets - buildings, equipment)
				3. Why calculate gross profit?
					1. Tells how **efficiently** we are using an established labor & supplies (for manufacturing goods or offering services) to clients
						1. Measures **profitability** & **financial performance** of a business
					2. Tells costs needed to generate a revenue
						1. If COGS increases, gross profit decreases
							1. => Less money to deal with operating expenses
						2. If COGS decreases, there is more money to spend for business operations
		5. Hygene Financial parameters need to be taken care of
			1. If we see you will do or else we don't do (We need MIS)
5. Summary:
	1. Building brand (cheaper efficient, effective ways, ...) - be consistent (we are never done with branding - we always get new people) - Build brand first and then expand the market
		1. ROI driven channels
		2. Exhibitions
		3. Trade Shows
		4. ...
	2. Have stop loss
	3. Diverse portfolios (no spof)
	4. MIS - cache flow, expenses, marjins, gross & net profits (they must appear every-day)
