# Startup Boards: How to Run a Board Meeting #
1. CEO is responsible to manage the board and its tempo
	1. Board members should:
		1. Come to the meeting prepared
		2. Understand my expectations (set by me)
			1. Expectations are what I want from them in the board meeting
			2. Need to have consistency from board meeting to board meeting
	2. Time & Frequency of Board Meetings
		1. It is effective to have frequent board meetings
			1. Every month or 6 weeks, ..., sometimes daily
			2. Duration: 2-4 hours long - especially for early stage companies
				1. As the company gets bigger, frequency of board meetings might decrease
					1. Couple 100 people: Frequency can drop to quarterly
				2. Duration: might increase
					1. Couple 100 people: 5-6 hours typically
	3. CEO has to set expectations as to what the meeting is going to look like next time is key
	4. Board meetings can be ad-hoc if certain changes need board's involvement
		1. Telephone call
		2. Video conference
		3. In-person meeting
	5. **Good board is responsive and is available when CEO needs when something is needed (a decision, update, legal issue, or any transactional issues)**
	6. **What should I prepare for my board meetings?**
		1. Best board meeting: All members of the board are well prepared with all material about how the company is doing
			1. Include info about:
				1. Financials
				2. Products
				3. Sales
				4. Strategy
		2. Worst board meeting:
			1. CEO spits out to the board about what is happening
				1. Give the material in advance and give them a couple of days at-least to absorb the material in advance
			2. Board meetings must involve real conversation
	7. Setting expectations with the board:
		1. Attendance & engagement
			1. Do we expect board members to be in person or in a video conference at-least?
				1. I need to ensure that the board members have the infrastructure for high quality video conference (low friction for them to setup)
				2. I want board members to be in the moment and be fully engaged with the team during the board meeting
					1. Define that in advance - no checking mobile phones or any other distractions allowed
						1. I must adhere to that standards my-self (meet the expectations the best)
		2. Expectations:
			1. Send the board package when you say you will
			2. If the board meeting is for 3 hours, ensure we have a 5 minute break every hour
			3. Manage the time you spend on each topic
				1. Break-down and allocate time for each topic (CEO needs to manage this)
	8. Great CEOs follow up:
		1. CEOs must close loop after the board meeting
		2. **CEOs can send a note with a recap of key discussions**
			1. Board memebers are on the same page in terms of context
			2. It sets tone for continued interaction on those issues
			3. Gives an opportunity to reflect back on what was discussed in the previous board meetings and what actions were taken between previous board meeting and today
2. Brad's board meeting tips:

			1. Be respectful of what they like or don't like
		3. Keep things such as coffee, juice, soda, ... (whatever the board likes)
			1. Put energy into the board
