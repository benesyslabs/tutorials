# Home Made PCB by the Method of Screen Printing #
1. Used in PCB industries
2. Low cost and good quality
3. Mass production is possible
4. It is manual process - precision

## Frame ##
1. Rectangular 120 frame with silk threads
	1. Wrinkle free
	2. 120 threads
2. Apply emulsion
	1. In less light condition, mix emulsion and developer
		1. 9 parts emulsion to 1 part dichromate (developer)
		2. Obtain uniform mixture
3. Spread the mixture along the screen using an emulsifier
	1. 3 - 4 layers of emulsion
		1. First to rear of frame
		2. Second to front of frame
		3. Third to front of frame
		4. Last to rear of frame
	2. Dry the emulsion using hair dryer on both sides
4. Put on back of the frame the printed circuit (all three) on transparent sheets
	1. Put them on the opposite side
	2. Fix it with transparent tape
5. Turn the frame
6. Place a thin foam on top (opposite side)
7. Place glass covering the foam
8. Put weights on top to avoid separation of acetates, silk and glass
9. Expose to ultraviolet light for 13 minutes
10. Remove the glass and foam
11. Remove the acetates (circuits)
12. Wash the frame on both sides with pressured water
13. Dry it with hair dryer for 10 minutes
14. Now this screen can be re-used to print as many boards as possible
15. Place the frame on a table (preferably glass)
16. Hinge the frame to the table (to lift easily)
17. Place the boards under the screen (aligning with the circuit) and fix using adhesive tape (on the table)
	1. Put stops to avoid print from moving
18. Use UV ink and place above the circuit (using brush)
19. Spread the ink with spatula
20. Traces the paint with a spatula (the circuit should be visible)
21. Lift the frame (it should be flawless)
22. Oven dry the board for 10 minutes
23. Expose the card to ferric chloride
	1. Fountain is better
	2. Remove when copper gets removed
24. Remove using gloves
25. Wash the card thoroughly with water
26. Immerse the board in caustic soda to for a minute
27. Brush until all the paint gets removed (washing brush)
28. Wash to remove caustic soda
29. Dry using hair dryer
30. Perforations:
	1. Drill holes using drill gun
	2. Bits should be of different sizes
	3. With steel wool remove the perforations
	4. Clean card with napkin
31. Anti-solder
	1. Place card below frame
	2. Keep supports
	3. Apply generous amount of green UV paint
	4. Lift the frame and spread the paint on silk
	5. Place the frame on the board and then draw spatula several times to give good coating
	6. Prevents rust, short circuits and good presentation
	7. Dry the card 
	8. Bake the card in oven for 10 minutes (UV rays)
32. Mask printing
	1. Place card on the opposite side so that hols must match
	2. Tape it and place supports (stop)
	3. Apply white UV ink
	4. Spread the ink with spatula
	5. Dry it in UV rays for 10 minutes (baked it)
33. Apply rosin dissolved in thinner to the backside of the card
	1. For brilliant finish
