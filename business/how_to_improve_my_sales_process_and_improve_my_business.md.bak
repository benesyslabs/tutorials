# How to Improve Your Sales Process and Increase Business #
1. It is moral obligation is to sell hard and sell well
	1. Business: When we solve a client's problem for a profit (if no profit, I am an NGO)
		1. If we don't, we will struggle for success
2. Most businesses do not have a sales process defined
	1. If we don't have a pre-defined process: I will be doing most of the things, I will not scale up
		1. Bring sales
		2. Convert sales
		3. Bring revenue
		4. Serve customers
	2. Solution:
		1. We have systems and processes (pre-defined processes)
		2. We are not doing everything
3. Basic elements of healthy sales process
	1. Element 1: Prospecting
		1. 99% of businesses fail in sales because they fail in sourcing leads to sell their products and services (exact number of leads)
		2. **Find out who are your prospective customers**
			1. **People who are interested in buying my product/service**
				1. **Fixing channels to source them** (don't go searching for customers)
					1. **What channels?**
						1. **Promoting on social media**
						2. **Search engine marketing**
						3. **Cold calling database**
						4. **Participating in networking event**
						5. **Participating trade shows** (**Online also**)
						6. **Buyer/Seller meets**
						7. **Summits**
						8. **Networking associations (BNI say)**
					2. **Never depend on only 1 channel**
		3. **Key to prospecting right is understanding target market**
			1. **Then define channels then**
				1. **Buyer's perspective**: Buyer is becoming aware from his perspective (win-win)
					1. **They must be aware that I as a business will solve their problem(s)**
						1. **If they are aware about this, they will incline towards me**
						2. **Awareness types**
							1. **Some problems I can solve for the buyer**
							2. **I am such and such brand that does such and such work**
							3. **Products/services I offer**
	2. Element 2: Qualifying Prospects
		1. Not all prospects have the same value
			1. **If we don't sense or have systems around it, we will be wasting time on people a) who don't want to buy at that moment b) who don't feel the importance to buy it c) who don't have a burning need**
			2. **Rank them**
				1. **Hot** - ready to buy
				2. **Warm** - they understand and might consider
				3. **Cold** - they are not ready
		2. 4 major parameters to quality a prospect
			1. Need: **Find out customer's needs** (We come to know through conversation OR they fill a form OR they have a qualifying call (zoom call, face-face face conversation, telephonic call, format filled by them, Q&A or survey done)
				1. **How strong are their needs to buy my products or services?**
					1. **How big is the problem that I am solving for the customer?**
						1. **Bigger the problem, bigger the need**
							1. **Perspective**
			2. Time: **How urgently do they want it?**
				1. Weeks, months, years, lifetimes
				2. **How quickly do they want to take action?**
			3. Money: **Can they afford the products and services I have?**
				1. **Do they have the resources for it?**
				2. **Humbly let them know what best I can do**
					1. **Guide them to someone else and help them**
			4. Decision making: **Can they make a decision?**
				1. **Do they have to involve someone else or can they make it on their own?**
					1. **Get the other person involved if required and close it**
		3. Buyer side: They are qualifying if I am the right fit to solve their problem
			1. **They decide if they will go with me or not**
				1. **Let them know what I can do**
					1. **If it is not a good fit, let the customer go** (or else it causes heart burns in the long run)
	3. Element 3: Demonstrate Value
		1. **This is the stage where we actually showcase how can I help them**
			1. **Product demo**
			2. **Short trial**
			3. **Free consultation**
			4. **Presentation**
			5. **Sample**
		2. **Demonstrate what value I can offer if customer boards with me**
			1. **If the customer comes on board, this is how the entire thing will go: Give them a demo**
				1. **Show previous clients**
				2. **Show them portfolio**
				3. **Show them the kind of work that I have done**
				4. **Show them styling that I can do**
				5. **Show them certificates I have**
		3. **Buyer's perspective**
			1. Developed interest (seeing demonstration)
				1. **Get them into buying mode**
	4. Element 4: Proposal
		1. We discuss
			1. **Terms and conditions**
			2. **Payment plans**
			3. **Financing solutions**
			4. **Duration of services**
			5. **Support that I will offer**
			6. **Bonuses that can help them make the best use of products or services**
				1. **They must be relevant to the product or service**
					1. **cross selling**
		2. Buyer's perspective
			1. **I am taking commitment or demanding comitment**
				1. **Comitment must be part of the culture of the team so that the team will also follow that comitment**
				2. **My team and myself will do our best in-spite of gaps**
	5. Element 5: Negotiate and Close
		1. **Most crucial part of sales process**
		2. **This is where people drop the ball**
		3. **This process converts a prospect into a paying customer**
		4. **Activities**
			1. **Help them with support**
			2. **Handle their objection**
			3. **Solve their queries**
		5. This helps us close the deal (by effective negotiating effectively)
			1. **Golden rule of negotiation**
				1. **Be very clear on what I am ready to lose and what terms are non-negotiable**
		6. **Types of closing**
			1. **Trial close**
				1. **Keep asking for comitment**
					1. **Seems okay? Let us close it?** (3-4 times)
						1. **If customer comes with an objection, then handle it and try to close again**
			2. **Emotional close**
				1. **I am there for you. I will ensure you are satisfied**
					1. **If client is looking at emotional comfort**
						1. **Wedding plan say**
				2. **Friendly close**
				3. **Supportive close**
					1. **Let them know what you will do to support**
			3. **Scarcity close**
				1. **This is added to the offer and if you are not buying now, you will lose the offer**
		7. **How to get better at closing**
			1. **Do it again and again and again and ...** (keep doing it to get good at it)
				1. **Everytime you lose, take feedback and learn**
					1. **Be open to feedback and improve**
						1. What went wrong?
						2. What went right?
						3. What can be done better next time?
					2. **Learn from each case**
4. **Take care of the 5 elements and sales is taken care of**
