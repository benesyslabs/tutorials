# The Future of Integration #
1. Integration is a core subject
2. New technologies
	1. API management
	2. GraphQL
	3. Data virtualization
3. Technological evolution
	1. Cloud and multi-cloud issue
		1. AWS
		2. Multi-cloud
			1. Companies want to integrate several clouds between them
				1. Integration is agnostic to the cloud provider
				2. Virtualizes the cloud as well
					1. Integration of data between AWS and Azure
						1. Integration tool can be installed on AWS or Azure and it does not matter
						2. Integration solution can manage execution location of the code according to performance, reliability and cost criteria
				3. Integration solution implementation can be platform specific (based on business need)
	2. Microservices to serverless
		1. The 'why' matters and not 'how'
			1. Setting up Nginx, Istio, Kubernetes is irrelevant
		2. Microservices has to more towards the ability to focus only on business code
			1. Technologies appearing have a goal to simplify the work of developers
				1. Serverless computing
					1. On large projects, there is no significant difference at this point in time
	3. Integration as a product
		1. Making integration easily available and off the shelf to app developers
		2. Making it
			1. Accessible to project managers
			2. Promoting its integraiton capabilities
			3. Re-selling them
		3. API does this for services but needs to do it for
			1. data
			2. events
			3. processes
			4. ad hoc tools
	4. Big Data and ELT
		1. They use many tools to integrate data into Big Data platform
		2. Need to cede the tools to integration managers
	5. New Integration Technologies
		1. GraphQL
			1. Accessibility of data
		2. Data virtualization
			1. Accessibility of data
		3. RPA
		4. Event driven technologies are expected to come next
