# How to Evaluate a Business Opportunity or an Idea #
1. This is for people who are looking for first business opportunity or new business opportunity
2. How to assess:
	1. Does the business opportunity or idea exists outside the current market & has a track record?
		1. There is no shame is taking an idea that has been original and successful from outside the target market
			1. We don't need novel ideas all the time
		2. Example: Flipkart took idea from Amazon and started in India
			1. Ola copied idea from Uber
		3. Look if an idea exists outside market that is working well. Find out how it works, change it according to current market and launch
			1. We don't have to do trial and error which has already been done
			2. Work out and fine tune to the local market
	2. Is the problem big enough that it requires a solution
		1. The biggest mistake which many young entrepreneurs make is that start working on ideas they feel will solve their problem (may be others are facing the same problem so this needs a solution)
			1. The problem may not be of very high intensity that everyone wants it to be solved
				1. The idea may go for a toss
					1. Solution: I may not be the best customer for myself
						1. Is the problem big enought?
						2. Do lot of people need the problem to be solved?
						3. How big is the challenge in their life?
					2. Implementation:
						1. Do some research
						2. Interview potential customers
						3. Do a survey (even online)
						4. Take feedbacks
						5. Do some market research
						6. Find out:
							1. Who else is facing the problem and what percentage
							2. How many people want to take action to solve the problem
							3. How high in the hierarchy the problem is
								1. If not we will end up convincing customer - not a good position to be in
						7. Assess negative impacts as well in terms of money and other side effects
							1. Customers should be prepared to pay
	3. Does the business opportunity or idea falls in a low net promoter score
		1. Net promoter score: If 100 people are using the products or services, what percentage of people are talking positively about it
			1. How many people say, this was my problem and this solved it and I am happy about the way I got the solution
			2. If say 80% are talking positively about it then NPS is 80%
		2. If a business opportunity or idea falls into low NPS, it is a great business opportunity to dwell into
			1. If we crib about the solution, then it is a good business opportunity
				1. Example: Commuting in Mumbai - very painful
					1. Taxis has issues
						1. standing on stand
						2. charge more
						3. refuse passengers
						4. meters are rigged
						5. ...
					2. This was a good opportunity for Uber and Ola
				2. Look for low NPS and work on it to solve it if possible
	4. How long will it take for you to recover your investment & make profits
		1. If a business has long gestation period before we start making profits, we may not be able to sustain it
			1. Solution: Choose wisely between funds we have and the business opportunity
				1. If we feel we can break up in 6 months, keep the funds for 1 year (double)
					1. Murphy's law: Whatever has to go wrong will go wrong
			2. In most cases BOs close down because they run out of funds
				1. Funds: Capex (capital) and Opex (running cost)
					1. When we are looking for profits - reduce it by 20% in calculation
						1. There are many places where profits will go down where we did not plan for
					2. When we are looking for expense - increase it by 20% in calculation
						1. There are many places where expenses might increase which we did not plan for
		2. Plan:
			1. **How much money is required to kickoff the business**
				1. Example: School, Restaurant ... are very highly capital intensive
				2. Where to put money?
					1. Setup
					2. Operations
					3. Marketing - **big money is required**
						1. Or else: DOA (Dead on Arrival)
					4. **Fund flow for your life must be different** (cannot be mixed)
						1. **We must have enough before we start so that we don't run out of funds**
							1. Solution: **Sit with a financial planner and estimate**
			2. **How mucy money is required to run the business**
			3. **How much time will be required to get the money back and make profits**
				1. **Only when sales numbers start going up, and when revenues start going up, we can recover the investment and make profits**

2. Popcorn moment: How long will it take to recover investment, NPS
3. Aha moment: Use existing idea and find tune it to my local market
