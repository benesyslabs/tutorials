1. Comes from watching what procedure is done in business (every tiny procedure) and writing them down step by step very simplistically
	1. Break them into smallest possible tasks and write them in written manual
		1. The manual/document can be used to train other people in the tasks
		2. Keep it simple
		3. Explain every detail (don't assume that people will know how to get the job done)
		4. Write and SOP for **every aspect** of business
			1. Standards will be maintained
				1. Ensures that things are done as they are supposed to be done in timely and effective manner
