## Frontend Development ##
### Technologies/ Languages ###
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. CSS Pre-process (Sass, Stylus...)
5. JavaScript Libraries (e.g. lodash) and Frameworks (Angular, React, Vue)
6. Build Tools (npm, Webpack, ...)

### You'll Work On ###
1. JS-driven User Interfaces
2. Re-usable UI Components with JS logic and CSS Styling
3. Forms & Input Validation
4. Backend Communication Channels
5. UX Strategies (PWAs, Live Updates)

### Less Relevant Technologies/ Languages ###
1. Server-Side Languages (e.g. Node, PHP)
2. Databases/ Query Languages (e.g. SQL)
3. Server Configuration

### You'll NOT work on ... ###
1. Server-Side Business Logic (e.g. User Authentication, Order Handling)
2. Automatic E-Mail Notifications
3. Database Access

## Backend Development ##
### Technologies/ Languages ###
1. Server-side Languages like Node, PHP
2. Frameworks like Express, Larevel
3. Databases & Query Languages (ORM, Packages)
4. Partly: Server Configuration
5. Basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### You'll Work On ... ###
1. Server-Side Business Logic (e.g. User Authentication, Order Handling)
2. Automatic Notifications
3. Data Validation (final say)
4. Data Storage/ Database Access
5. Scheduled Processes (calculation, cleanup)

### Less Relevant Technologies/ Languages ###
1. Advanced JavaScript & CSS (unless Node)
2. JavaScript Libraries & Frameworks of frontend (but needed for Node)
3. Build Tools (npm (but Node), Webpack)

### You'll NOT Work On... ###
1. Client-side Validation
2. Complex User Interfaces
3. Advanced UX Strategies (PWAs, ...)

## Fullstack Development ##
### Technologies/ Languages (not expert in everything) ###
1. HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2. Server-Side Languages like Node
3. Server-Side Frameworks like Express
4. Advanced JavaScript & CSS
5. Basic JS Libraries/ Frameworks
6. Database & Query Language

### You'll Work On ... ###
1. Both Server-side Logic and Client-side User Interfaces
2. Client-side and Server-side Data Validation
3. Data Storage/ Database Access
4. Everthing else

### Less Relevant Technologies/ Langauges ###
1. Advanced Libraries or Frameworks (both on Backend and Frontend)
2. Build Tools (use Templates/CLIs instead)

### You'll NOT Work On ... ###
1. Very Complex User Interfaces
2. Very Complex Server-Side Logic (not every app is super complex)

## What is Better? ##
### Frontend ###
1. Extremely Fast Development Technologies & the Ecosystem
2. Growing Demand in Developers
3. Downside: Use the User Interface

### Backend ###
1. Security stays important, ever more Data and User Interactions require "better" Algorithms and Processes
2. Growing Demand in Developers
3. Downside: No Direct Connection to the User/Customer

### Fullstack ###
1. No/Little Dependencies on other Developers, Full Understanding of the Complete Tech Stack
2. Perfect for Small Companies & Freelancers (not in big companies or big projects)
3. Downside: Jack of all Trades

## Approach ##
1. Be a full stack but specialize in one of them
