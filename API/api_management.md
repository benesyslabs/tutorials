# API Management #
1. APIs are like synapses that allow our interconnected world to communicate
2. Requirements for API
	1. Service
	2. Secure
	3. Evolve
	4. Always on
3. Topics:
	1. API Management patterns
	2. Managing SDKs across languages
	3. APIs and their role in microservices
	4. Security
	5. Best practices
	6. Overview of Evolution
4. Customer's expectations
	1. SDKs
	2. Documentation
5. The guide is for best practices

## Executive Summary ##
1. APIs make softwares better and other softwares better by extension

### As Easy as API ###
#### Data ####
1. Important attributes of quality API
	1. Simplicity
	2. Performance
	3. Consistency
	4. Documentation

#### Implications ####
1. APIs must be easy to use
2. APIs must be reliable
2. APIs must have documentation which can be referred to by developers

#### Recommendations ####
1. Thorough documentation is required
2. Compile to easily search format
3. extensive instructions are required

### Developers at REST ###
#### Data ####
1. Most users prefer REST API and hardly avoid using REST

#### Implications ####
1. REST is most popular for building web services
2. REST is preferred for new APIs

#### Recommendations ####
1. REST is for high performance
2. REST enables re-use of components without affecting the entire system

### The Way of APIs ###
#### Data ####
1. Majority survey respondents implement APIs for customers to integrate their software with API providers
2. Many encourage users to find new innovative solutions using software
3. Many implement them for mobile device support
4. Some monetize the APIs
5. Some implement APIs for IoT device support

#### Implications ####
1. Companies allow customers to develop their own integration solutions by developing APIs
2. APIs are developed for multiple platforms (Mobile and IoT) without porting for each device platform

#### Recommendations ####
1. APIs must be secure

## Key Research Findings ##
### Demographics ###
1. Java most popular at work
2. Web apps/services (SaaS) most popular
3. Enterprise buisiness apps are somewhat in the middle

### The Need for Greater Simplicity ###
1. Developers spend much time on integration
	1. Most consuming levels of integration process
		1. application/communication level
		2. Method/business process level (allowing multiple apps to access one another's methods)
		3. Data level
		4. UI level (presenting multiple apps to users at once)
2. Solution: Simplicity of APIs (most important quality attribute)
	1. Next: Performance/ Robustness
	2. Next: Consistency

### Integration, APIs, and Open-Source Tools ###
1. Users integrate the following with APIs
	1. Mobile systems
	2. BI/analytics systems
	3. CRM systems
	4. ...
2. Other needs for integration
	1. Mobile: need for mobile support
	2. BI/analytics and CRM: encouraging users to develop new solutions using APIs
3. Why integrate?
	1. Sending messages among apps
	2. Sharing common database among different apps
	3. Transfering files among different apps
4. Most popular integration frameworks (open source are most popular)
	1. Spring integration
	2. Apache camel
	3. Messaging:
		1. Apache Kafka
		2. RabbitMQ
		3. ActiveMQ
	4. Design and documentation of RESTful APIs and API management
		1. Swagger

### RESTful APIs and Data Exchange Formats ###
1. REST is most popular
2. Versioning (popularity order)
	1. In endpoint URI without aliases
	2. In endpoint URI with backward compatible aliases
	3. No versioning
	4. API gateway with routing
	5. In codebase
3. Popular data formats (in order)
	1. JSON (serialization and interchange)
	2. YAML is picking up
	3. [JSON Over XML](https://dzone.com/articles/why-you-cloud-be-using-json-vs-xml)
		1. JSON is better for
