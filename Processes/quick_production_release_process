Steps for quick release to production:
1. Get existing production environment information
	1. RFC numbers
	1. Artifact versions
	2. Code base versions used to generate artifacts
2. Prepare local environment to correspond to production
	1. Check out the source codes of the code base versions
	2. Build and deploy the artifacts to local environment(s)
3. Prepare lower environment to correspond to production
	1. Deploy artifacts to lower environment
4. Fix the issue and verify locally
	1. Build and deploy to local environment
5. Release the fix to local environment
6. Verify the fix
7. Release the fix to lower environment
8. Perform quick sanity and regression testing on lower environment
9. Prepare release notes and artifacts and get it reviewed
9. Share release notes and artifacts to deployment team
