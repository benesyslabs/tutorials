## Interview Preparation ##
### Reference ###
1. Process
	1. Resume submission
	2. Resume screen
	3. Internal reference (it may go through resume screen but may not and interview process may start immediately)
	4. Recruiter contact - they may contact you directly looking into the Linkedin page, contacts, ...
2. How referee works
	1. Internal Reference
		1. Can initiate interview process (higher chance)
		2. Higher chance to have an interview
			1. They may work as external reference
				1. If contacted by recruiter and passed onsite interviews
	2. External reference check (if they work for different company, they may talk about your work style, how smart you are, ...)
		1. Final review
		2. Ask details about past work experience
	3. Internal job introduction
		1. When a company has opening positions, your referees may contact you (internally if they cannot fill in, they may find you)
		2. They may receive Referral bonus
3. Who are referees
	1. First-hand experience (with you)
		1. Co-worker, labmate, dissertion advisor
		2. Anybody who can talk about you from objective perspective
	2. Second-hand experience
		1. Former class mate, former TA (how did I study or how smart I am but they did not work with me on a project)
4. Social Interaction
	1. Met in a conference (attended their presentation or they attended your presentation)
	2. Did non-professional work together (voluntary work)
	3. Friend who knows some of your non-job related work (something together on a project)
5. Building reference network
	1. Takes long time

	2. Try internship
		1. Best way to build references (internships at companies)
		2. Try different companies
	3. 6-10 references takes several years
6. Maintain Connection

	2. Update how you are doing (course or project, ..., companies worked on)
	3. No worries, they don't skip (even if they don't reply they usually read)
		1. Do you know any opening position and you know what I have been doing
		2. They may give an outline of what you have been doing and may recommend that you are very good
8. Investment
	1. Invest time, energy, and money for building and maintaining reference network
	2. Be memorable (when you send email saying you are looking for a job)
	3. Give a small gift when you meet
9. Recap

### Sorting Algorithms ###
1. Widely used algorithms
	1. Merge sort, quick sort, bubble sort, heap sort
	2. Binary tree sort
	3. Basic operations
	4. Space/ time complexity
2. Implementations
	1. How to sort primitives and objects in your language
	2. Which are implemented underneath `sorting` functions
		1. Java
3. Bubble sort
	1. Bubble the max element to farthest right possible
	2. Repeated until sort is completed
4. Merge sort
	1. Faster than bubble sort
	2. Divides arrays into smaller groups recursively
	3. Merges numbers into bigger groups
5. Heap sort
	1. Internally it uses min-heap or max-heap
6. Binary tree sort
	1. nlog(n)
7. Quick sort
	1. Select a pivot
	2. move every element of pivot to left and larger ones to right
	3. Recursively perform this operation for smaller groups
8. Space/ Time complexity
	1. Quick sort: space - O(log n)*, time - O(n log n), O(n^2), O(n)
	2. Merge sort: space - O(log n)*, time - O(n log n), O(n log n), O( n log n)
	3. Heap sort: space - O(1)*, time - O(n log n), O(n log n), O(n log n)
	4. Binary tree sort: space - O(n), time - O(n log n), O(n^2), O(n log n)
	5. Bubble sort: space - O(1)*, time - O(n^2), O(n^2), O(n)
9. Sorting in C++
	1. [www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/sort/](www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/sort/)
	
			// std::sort() is introsort.
			
			vector vec<int> = {5, 3, 7, -1, 6};
			
			std::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
			
			// or use lambda function
			
			std::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end(),
				[] (int a, int b) {
					return a > b;
				});
				
	2. Java:

			// uses quicksort for primitives
			int a1[] = {3, 4, 1, 5, 2, 6};
			
			Arrays.sort(a1); // quicksort internally
			
		1. For objects, merge sort is used

				Card[] hand = new Card[5];
				
				Random rand = new Random();
				
				for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
					hand[i] = new Card(rand.nextInt(5));
				}
				
				Arrays.sort(hand); // merge sort
				
		2. Python uses a variation of merge sort for numbers

				# Adaptive merge sort
				>>> sorted([5, 2, 3, 1, 4])
				[1, 2, 3, 4 , 5]
				>>> a = [5, 2, 3, 1, 4]
				>>> a.sort()
				>>> a
				[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
				
			1. Tuples and objects are also sorted in python

					>>> student_tuples = [
						('john', 'A', 15),
						('jane', 'B', 12),
						('dave', 'B', 10),
					]
					>>> sorted(stuent_tuples, key=lambda student: student[2]) # sort by age	

### Binary Trees ###

3. Average time complexity:
	1. Lookup: O(log n)
	2. Insertion: O(log n)
	3. Deletion: O(log n)
4. Space: O(n)
5. Binary tree traversal

	3. Post-order traversal: left - right - self
6. Serialization and deserialization of binary tree

### String Manipulation ###
1. String matching
	1. Compare two string
		1. Find occurrences of a pattern in the text.
		2. Widely used in web search, dictionary search, ...
		3. String 1: abcdefghijklmnopqrstu
		4. String 2: ijk
		5. Find index
2. Naive algorithm
	1. Check starting from index 0
	2. If no match, move by one index
	3. O(nm) - m is pattern length
3. Rabin-Karp algorithm
	1. Preprocesses the input string
		1. String 1: abdc....u
		2. String 1 hash: 369....
		3. String 2: ijk
		4. String 2 hash: 17
		5. Find hash for triplets: abc, bcd, cdf, ....
		6. Find where the hash of String 2 is
		7. Average complexity: O(n + m)
4. Find required substring
	1. Find the longest substring with 2 unique characters
		1. Input: assdeeeddffffha
		2. Output: deeedd
	2. Naive algorithm: O(n^3)
	3. Linear Search Algorithm
		1. Increase end index until the substring has only two chars
5. Find longest word containing input chars
	1. Input dic: { 'act', 'acquaintance', 'trace'}
		1. Input: cat
		2. Output: acquaintance
	2. Questions to ask
		1. Lower case?
		2. Dictionary size?
	3. Algorithm 1:
		1. Naive
			1. compare each word with inputs and find longest
	4. Algorithm 2:
		1. Convert each word to a token
		2. Try `and` operation
6. Longest string search
	1. algorithm + presort dictionary by length
		1. Average time complexity of this algo is same as before but in practice it is faster
	2. algorithm 4
		1. Algorithm 3 + build sorted char index
			1. Example: If we are searching for `c`, we can sort all words containing `c` by length and pickup the longest
7. Typical mistakes:
	1. Example:

			string FindAs(const string& input) {
				string out;
				for (int i = 0; i < input.size(); i++) {
					if (input[i] == 'a') {
						out += input[i]; // releases memory for out and re-allocates again - inefficient
					}
				}
				return out;
			}
			
		1. Solution: pre-allocate the memory and shrink the memory at the end

				string FindAs(const string& input) {
					string out;
					out.reserve(input.size()); // pre-allocation
					for (int i = 0; i < input.size(); i++) {
						if (input[i] == 'a') {
							out += input[i];
						}
					}
					out.shrink_to_fit(); // shink to fit
					return out;
				}

2. Find the deepest node in BST
	1. When we queue, we increment the level
1. pre-order, in-order, post-order are DFS
2. BFS: visit root node, then all it's children and then the next level (by level)
3. Pseudo-code

		Stor the root node in Container
		While (there are nodes in Container)
			N = Get the "next" node from Container
			Store all the children of N in Container
			Do some work on N
			
	1. DFS: Container - Stack
	2. BFS: Container - Queue
4. Example: Count # of islands

		000000
		00xx00
		0000x0
		00000x
		
	1. Only vertical and horizontal x's are assumed connected
	2. Example implementation:

			public class Count

### Dynamic Program ###
1. Dynamic program
	1. Algorithm for solving a problem by identifying a collection of subproblems and its starting state
2. Characteristics of DP problems
	1. Solution to the problem depends on the solution(s) of sub-problems
3. Example: Longest increasing sub-sequence (it need not be consecutive sequence)
	1. Longest sub-sequence ending at ith node
4. Fibonacci number
5. Example: Find lowest cost graph path from A to N
	1. Find lowest cost paths from A-K, A-L, A-M

			int* memoize;
			int ComputeFibonacciHelper(int n) {
				assert_true(n < 0);
				if (memoize[n] < 0) {
					memoize[n] = ComputeFibonacciHelper(n - 1) + ComputeFibonacciHelper(n - 2);
				}
				return memoize[n];
			}

			int ComputeFibonacci(int n) {
				memoize = new int[n + 1];
				for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
					memoize[i] = -1;
				}
				memoize[0] = 0;
				memoize[1] = 1;
				memoize[2] = 1;
				int fibonacci_number = ComputeFibonacciHelper(n);
				delete memoize;
				return fibonacci_number;
			}

### Multithreading/ Concurrency ###
1. Definition
	1. Concurrency (like in one core)
		1. Running multiple tasks at almost the same time in some unspecified order
	2. Parallelism (multiple cores)
		1. Running multiple tasks at the same time
	3. Multithreading
		1. For allowing concurrency within each process
2. Multi-threaded program

		void CallFromThread() {
			printf("Hello, World\n");
		}

		int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
			// Launch a new thread
			thread t1(CallFromThread);
			// Join the thread with the main thread
			t1.join();
			return 0;
		}
		
5. Multithreaded-program:

		#include <stdio.h>
		#include <thread>

		void CallFromThread(int thread_id)
		{
			printf("Thread ID: %d\n", thread_id);
		}
		
		int main(int argc, char* argv[])
		{
			constexpr int kNumThreads = 5;
			thread t[kNumThreads];
			// Launch a group of threads
			for (int i = 0; i < kNumThreads; i++)
			{
				t[i] = thread(CallFromThread, i);
			}
			
			printf("Launched from the main\n");
			
			// Join the threads with the main thread
			for (int i = 0; i < kNumThreads; i++)
			{
				t[i].join();
			}
			return 0;
		}
		
	1. `g++ -std=c++11 -o multiple_threads multiple_threads.cpp`
6. Shared resources
	1. Critical section
		1. Section in the program where two or more threads might try to access the same resource. Potential race condition
	2. Semaphore
		1. Shared resource access with a maximum concurrency.
			1. Usage: control access to a limited number of resources being shared by multiple threads
				1. Ex: limit the max # of threads accessing database (connection limit)
	3. Mutex
		1. Mutually exclusive resource access
			1. A special case of Semaphore with max thread of 1
		2. Example:

				std::mutex m;
				int i = 0;
				void makeACallFromPhoneBooth()
				{
					m.lock();
					printf("%d Hello Wife\n", i++);
					m.unlock();
				}
				int main(int argc, char* argv[])
				{
					thread man1(MakeACallFromPhoneBooth);
					thread man2(MakeACallFromPhoneBooth);
					thread man3(MakeACallFromPhoneBooth);
					man1.join();
					man2.join();
					man3.join();
					return 0;
				}
				
7. Busy waiting:
	1. Waiting for some future event with repeatedly checking if the event happens
	2. Example:

			mutex m;
			int i = 0;
			void IncrementCounter()
			{
				sleep(1000);
				lock_guard<mutex> lock(m);
				i++; // shared resource
			}
			int main(int argc, char* argv[])
			{
				thread increment_counter(IncrementCounter);
				while (true)
				{
					lock_guard<mutex> lock(m);
					if (i >= 1) break;
				}
				increment_counter.join();
				return 0;
			}
			
8. How to avoid busy wait:

		Use `Semaphore` (Python/Java, not C++)
		Use `Event` (Python) or `CountDownLatch` (Java)
		Use `Sleep(0)` - just changes priority of the task so that other jobs can run
9. Recap:
	1. Concurrency, Parallelism, Multithreading
	2. Shared Resources
		1. Critical section, mutex, semaphore
	3. Busy Waiting

### Design Question ###
1. Question scope

	2. Evaluate in terms of efficiency, reliability, portability, extensibility, complexity, performance, scalability, etc
2. New Design
	1. (Maybe) outside your knowledge or past experience
		1. How can I handle the challenge
3. Target Interviewee

	2. They want to know how I approach the process
	3. From user's point of view
5. How to make photo sharing service for 1B users
	1. Like instagram, user's new photo should be shared with 1B users instantly. (with friends or friend's friends)
		1. Where/ how to store the images?
			1. Where do we want to deploy the serving servers and database servers
			2. Find list of photos that user wants to share
		2. How to find images in chronological order in distributed database?

			2. How to distribute
			3. How to fetch
			4. How to serve
6. Design distributed file system in the moon
	1. 100 file servers in the moon
		1. Send from earth file server to 100 file servers on the moon separately?
		2. Send as a broadcast?
		3. Send to a central server on the moon and distribute locally?
	2. How to securely transfer your file to them?
		1. Transmission channel is un-secure and noisy
	3. How to search files in the system?
		1. Send query to all servers?
		2. Send to one server and wait?
	4. How to read files from it?
		1. Ask server to send a packet multiple times?
		2. Error correction code
		3. Source coding scheme
		4. Special way to transfer
7. How to approach?
	1. Ask clarifying questions
	2. How many total users/ concurrent users?
		1. How widely it is distributed?
	3. How are servers connected?
	4. How strong security is required?
		1. For photos it is very important
		2. For road traffic doesn't have to be secure (for faster transmission)
	5. How much delay can be tolerated?
	6. How much errors could be accepted?
8. Design Electric vehicle charging availability app
	1. Building an app showing available/ unavailable chargin stations on the map
	2. 10M charging stations all over the world
		1. Show only a few of them
		2. Latitude and longitude zoom level
	3. Design a system that returns charging station list to the map
	4. How to update charging station changes?
	5. Have another layer with statistics

	6. What is the tolerant time delay?
	7. Show updates online? Or no?
	8. How many concurrent users?
	9. How are they distributed?
9. Good approach:
	1. Build a scenario:
		1. App sends a request with latitude, longitude, and zoom level
		2. Find charging stations near the input lat/lon/zoom
		3. Return the entire list of charging stations or a snippet of it
		4. App displays all or some of the charging stations
			1. Or statistics
		5. Prefetch nearby charging stations in multiple zoom level
10. Recap:
	1. Design questions are daunting
	2. Ask scoping questions
	3. Build scenario

### Frequent Coding Mistakes ###
1. Missing input Parameter Check

		void DoSomething(int index, double probability, vector<double> c) {
			c[index] = probability;	
		}
		
	1. Yellow signal:
		1. If index is negative?
		2. What if probability is negative?
		3. If vector is empty?
		4. Copying vector of double (value copying)

				CHECK(index >= 0);
				CHECK(probability >= 0.0);
				CHECK(index < c.size());
				
			1. `vector<double> &c` - pass reference
2. If function has input pointer
	1. Check if pointer is nullpointer

			CHECK(b != nullptr);
			
3. Check if variable is initialized or not

		void DoSometing() {
			int c = 0; // initialize
			int a = 1;
			//...
		}
		
4. Pointer/ Value misuse

		int a = 10;
		int *p = &a;
		if (p > 5) printf("bigger than 5"); // wrong (*p > 5)
		
5. Unitialized memory

		int *b = new int[1];
		if (b > 0) printf("positive"); // uninitialized
		
6. Assignment vs Comparison

		if (a = 1) {
			// ...
		}
		
7. Out of bounds memory access

		int a[10];
		for (int i = 0; i < 11; i++) a[i] = 0; // out of boundary
		
8. Logical vs Bitwise operator

		int a = 1; int b = 3;
		if (a & b) printf("found it"); // bitwise and not logical operator
		int c = a || 16; // not bitwise but logical
		if (c > 10) printf("wow");
		
9. Missing break switch

		int m = 1;
		switch (m) {
			case 0: printf("zero"); break;
			case 1: printf("one"); break;
			default: printf("default");
		}
		
10. Comparing floating point values

		double a = 1.0;
		double b = 0.9 + 0.1;
		if (a == b) printf("same"); // they may not be the same because floats may have different precisions
	
	1. Solution:

			if (fabs(b - a) < 1e-8) printf("same");
			
11. Arithmetic operation stability

		double a = 1.0;
		double b = 1.1;
		double c1 = a + b;
		double c2 = b + a;
		if (c1 == c2) printf("same"); // they may not be same and unlikely if adding many numbers and high precision values (order may matter)
		
	1. Solution:

			if (fabs(c1 - c2) < 1e-8) printf("same");
