# Brainstorming #
## Introduction ##
1. Group activity technique used to put efforts to find conclusion (solution/not) for specific problem
	1. A list of ideas are gathered spontaneously contributed by team members
2. A group of people meet to generate new ideas and solutions around specific domain of interest by removing inhibitions
	1. People can think freely
	2. People can suggest as many spontaneous new ideas as possible
	3. 'All' ideas are noted down
	4. Ideas are not criticized
	5. After the session, ideas are evaluated 

## Osborn's method ##
1. Two principles contribute to "ideative efficacy"
	1. Defer judgment
	2. Reach for quantity (?)
2. Rules of brainstorming
	1. Reduce social inhibitions among group members
	2. Stimulate idea generation
	3. Increase overall creativity of the group
3. **Go for quantity**
	1. Maxim: quantity breeds quality (rule of thumb)
		1. Greater the number of ideas generated, the bigger the chance of producing a radical and effective solution
4. **Withhold Criticism**
	1. Criticism should be put 'on hold'
		1. Participants should focus on extending or adding to ideas
		2. Reserver criticism to later 'critical stage' of process
		3. Suspending judgment will enable participants to freely generate unusual ideas
5. **Welcome Wild Ideas**
	1. Get a good and long list of:
		1. Suggestions
		2. Wild ideas
	2. Team can look from new perspectives and **suspending assumptions**
		1. New way of thinking can give better solutions
6. **Combine and Improve Ideas**
	1. "1 + 1 = 3" works for teams
		1. [Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(psychology)) - mental connections between concepts, events and mental states...
			1. Process used to stimulate building of ideas

### Applications ###
1. Brainstorming should address specific question

### Groups ###
1. Groups of 12
	1. Include
		1. Experts
		2. Novices

3. Ideas should not receive criticism or discussion
4. Ideas might lead to a solution
	1. No analytical judgment must not be applied as to feasibility
		1. Judgements are received for a later date

## Variations ##
### Nominal Group Technique ###
1. Participants are asked to write their ideas anonymously
2. Facilitator collects ideas and group votes on each idea
	1. Show of hands may suffice

3. Top ranked ideas can be sent back to group or to subgroups for further brainstorming
	1. One group may work on color
	2. One group may work on size
	3. ...
4. Each group can come back to whole group for ranking listed ideas
	1. Previously dropped ideas may be brought forward sometimes
		1. Ideas can be re-evaluated
5. Facilitator should be trained in this process before attempting to facilitate the technique
	1. Group should be encouraged (if required taught) to embrace the process

### Group Passing Technique ###
1. Each person in a circular group writes down an idea

3. Second person adds some thoughts
4. The process continues until everybody gets his or her original piece of paper back
	1. Group may have extensively elaborated on each idea
5. "idea book": 
	1. distribution list or routing slip is posted to the front of the book
	2. First page may have a description of the problem
	3. First person lists his/her ideas and routes the book to next person on the distribution list
	4. Second person can log new ideas or can add to ideas of the previous person
	5. Continue until the distribution list is exhausted
	6. "read-out" meeting: follow up to discuss ideas logged in the book
	8. Pros and Cons: takes longer but individuals can think deeply about a problem

### Team Idea Mapping Method ###
1. Association:
	1. It can improve collaboration and increase quantity of ideas
	2. It is designed for all attendees to participate and no ideas are rejected
2. Process:
	1. Have a well defined topic
	2. Each participant brainstorms individually
	3. All ideas are merged into one large idea map
		1. During consolidation phase, participants may discover common understanding of issues as they share meanings behind their ideas
		2. New ideas may arise during the sharing
			1. These are added to the map as well
	4. Once all ideas are captured, group can prioritize and/or take action

### Directed Brainstorming ###
1. A variation of electronic brainstorming
	1. Manual or using computers
2. Pre-requisite: solution space (set of criteria for evaluating a good idea) is known prior to the session
	1. The criteria can be used to constrain the process intentionally
3. Process:
	1. Each participant is given one sheet of paper (or electronic form) and the brainstorming question is told
	2. Participants produce one response and stop
	3. All papers are randomly swapped among the participants
	4. Participants can look into the idea and come up with a new idea that improves on the idea (based on initial criteria)
	5. Forms are swapped again and respondents are asked to improve upon the ideas
	6. The process is repeated for 3-4 rounds

### Guided Brainstorming ###
1. Time is set aside to brainstorm on a particular subject

7. After guided brainstorming session, participants rank ideas for 
	1. Further brainstorming
	2. Research
	3. Questions remaining unanswered
