1. [https://medium.com/@alimirio/before-you-start-solving-problems-on-leetcode-prep-work-9d65fc964c6f](https://medium.com/@alimirio/before-you-start-solving-problems-on-leetcode-prep-work-9d65fc964c6f)

## Data Structures ##
1. Dynamic Array
2. Linked List
3. Stack & Queue
4. Hash Tables
5. Binary Search Tree
6. Binary Heaps & Priority Queue
7. Graphs
8. Trie

## Algorithms ##
1. Bit Manipulation & Numbers - difference btw Unsigned vs signed numbers
2. Stability in Sorting
3. Mergesort
4. Quicksort
5. Heapsort - Sort it in place to get O(1) space
6. Binary Search
7. Selections - Kth Smallest Elements (Sort, QuickSelect, Mediums of Mediums) - Implement all three ways
8. Permutations
9. Subsets
10. BFS Graph
11. DFS Graph
12. Dijkstra's Algorithm (just learn the idea - no need to implement)
13. Tree Traversals - BFS, DFS (in-order, pre-order, post-order): Implement Recursive and Iterative
14. External Sort - No implementation; Just know the concept
15. NP-Complete (video) - Just know the concept
16. Topological Sort
17. Detect cycle in an undirected graph
18. Detect cycle in a directed graph
19. Count connected components in a graph
20. Find strongly connected components in a graph

## Prep Work ##
1. Do following exercise multiple times (at least 2-3 times) until you can do them with your eyes closed
2. Exercises
	1. Implement an ArrayList from scratch
	2. Reverse a linked list
	3. Implement a Stack & a Queue using Array
	4. Implement a HashTable with simple Hashing functions
	5. Implement a Graph using Adjacency List, and then write functions for BFS & DFS
	6. Write the binary search algorithm both recursively and iteratively
	7. Write the merge sort algorithm
	8. Write the quicksort algorithm
	9. Print binary tree using DFS (in-order, preorder, and post order - all three of them) and BFS
	10. Memorize time & space complexities for common algorithms [Intersting Website](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)
	11. Implement a trie
	12. Learn important bit manipulation tricks
