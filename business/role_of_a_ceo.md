1. Role of a CEO:
	1. Construct strategy & vision and then communicate it
	2. Build a team

	3. Make sure there is enough cash in the bank
		1. Make sure the company executes its plan and has cash in the bank (properly financed)
2. All three functions are critical
3. Defining your vision
	1. Setting is important and articulating the vision is more important
		1. Must be able to communicate the vision so that it translates and makes sense to all the different constituances or stakeholders of the company
		2. Stakeholders

			2. Customers
			3. Potential investors or shareholders
	2. The **CEO's comminication** of the vision & strategy is just as important as the vision itself
		1. This ensures we rally people to our cause
4. Building a team
	1. CEO's role around talent (human capital):
		1. Selection:
			1. Figuring out who to bring to the organization is critical (early days especially)
				1. First 5 to 10 employees make or break the business
					1. They must do the lion's share of work (not me)
					2. They must have a lot of power in shaping the culture and practices and behaviours of the organization
		2. Motivation:
			1. CEOs are leaders & managers
				1. Ensures that the workforce is motivated to jump out of bed in the morning and give their absolute best for 8-15 hours
					1. This is what drives the business forward

5. Executing the Plan
	1. Execution is linked to motivation of people in the organization & strategy set by me
	2. Ensure that goals are clear
	3. Ensure that everyone is pointed and rolling in the same direction
	4. Ensure that deadlines are respected and people are held accountable for results
	5. Ensure there is cash in the bank and that company is properly financed (gas in the tank)
