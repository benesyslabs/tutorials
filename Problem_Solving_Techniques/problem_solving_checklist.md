# Problem Solving Checklist #
1. How to Solve It - by G. Polya
	1. Step 1: Understand the problem
		1. What is the unknown? What are you trying to solve?
		2. What are the data, conditions, and constraints?
		3. Can you draw a figure or diagram of the problem?
			1. Screen mock-up
			2. ...
		4. Can you break the problem down into separate parts?
	2. Step 2: Device a plan
		1. Have you seen this problem (or a related one) before?
			1. Try to re-call a related problem
		2. Can you restate the problem?
			1. Translate the problem say from real-world domain to mathematical domain say
		3. Can you solve part of the problem?
			1. This can help us see more solutions
		4. Can you solve it by removing or changing part of the condition?
			1. Remove complex conditions and solve the problem
			2. Add the conditions back and solve the actual problem
		5. What can you devie from the available data?
			1. Sometimes we do not have all the data to solve the problem.
				1. We might have to derive the data from the data we have
	3. Step 3: Carry out the plan
		1. Can you prove that the result is correct?
		2. Did you use all of the available data?
		3. Did you use the whole condition?
		4. Did you apply all of the constraints?
	4. Step 4: Looking back
		1. Can you check the result ("do the math")? Does it make sense?
			1. Example: We estimate certain features and when we sum them up it must not be 3 years (look back and check)
		2. Can you derive the results differently?
