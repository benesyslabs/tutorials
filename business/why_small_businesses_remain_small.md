# Why Small Businesses Continue to Remain Small - Ameet Parekh #
1. Do not proper systems and processes in place
	1. They are running ad-hoc
	2. No processes predefined to run a business
	3. No methods to track the execution of activity
		1. Have they been done?
		2. Have they been done in a proper way?
		3. Are people working as per my satisfaction or not?
			1. No measurements (MIS systems)
				1. **Things business owners don't focus on will go in the drain**
				2. **Consistency doesn't exist**
					1. **Solution: Everyday must not be fire fighting. Proper systems and processes must be put in place**
					2. **Solution: Don't allow random things to be done**
2. Not building a team
	1. No skill/training/expertise (business owner does job for them also sometimes)
	2. Building capability
	3. Learn how to delegate work to them
		1. BO must focus on strategic growth and development
3. Preparing Reports
	1. MIS is required (Break-down Business into small departments - 7 - 15)
		1. For each department, define parameters that I want to track
			1. Basic 4-5 things in each department
			2. Prepare a reporting system for each department which the departments will fill and submit
			3. Next give ownership to execute and check the reports
				1. Whatever is measured is managed.
				2. Whatever can be managed can be grown
		2. Types of MIS
			1. **Marketing MIS**
			2. **Sales MIS**
			3. **Operational MIS**
			4. **Financial MIS**
4. Unwilling to Learn
	1. BO is unwilling to learn
		1. Don't acquire new capabilities
			1. **Business is a game of capabilities**
				1. **We need to learn the systems to use them effectively**
					1. **Make foundational knowledge strong** - **Be an expert to play with them properly**
