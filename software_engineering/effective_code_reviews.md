# Effective Code Reviews #
## Introduction ##
1. Code reviews help us improve quality of our code and overall system
2. It must be part of project culture

## What is a Code Review? ##
1. Formal definition:
	1. The activity of systematically examining computer source code with the intent of finding mistakes created or overlooked in the development rocess, and thus improving the overall quality of the software
2. Developers working on a project submit work to be reviewed by other developers on project or within organization
3. Reviewers look over code for flaws (logical, syntax, complexity, etc...)
	1. Design issues
		1. Return findings to submitted developer
4. Purpose is 4 fold:
	1. To ensure work performed matches work requested
	2. To catch as many bugs as possible before they get to production'
	3. To keep complexity of system low
	4. To ensure best practices are followed

## Why Do We Need Code Reviews? ##
1. There are other benefits (more than technical)

### Code Reviews Reduce Bugs/ Defects ###
1. Code reviews reduce number of defects introduced into software system
	1. "the average effectivenss of design and code inspections are 55 and 60%"
		1. 10-35% more effective than automated tests ([you should also be doing](https://samuelmullen.com/articles/tdd-youve-been-doing-it-all-along/))

### Code Reviews Improve the Speed of Development ###
1. Reviewing code can take a long time
	1. Especially if there are questions about patch or discussions which arise through the patch
2. Point of software development isn't producing code or features. It's to construct functioning product

### Code Reviews Encourage a Healthy Engineering Culture ###
## Process ##
### 4 Rules ###
### Submitting a Pull Request ###
### Reviewing a Pull Request ###
### Giving Feedback ###
#### Let Tools Be the Pedants ####
#### Ask Questions ####
#### Be Articulate ####
#### Citique the Code, Not the Coder ####
#### Compliment Good Code ####
### Receiving Feedback ###
## In Closing ##
