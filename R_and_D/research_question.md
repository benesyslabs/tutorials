# Research Question #
## Introduction ##
1. **Research Question** - It is
	1. objective study or

2. Types of research:
	1. [Quantitative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research)
	2. [Qualitative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research)
3. Forms of research question based on type of research
	1. [Thesis Statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis_statement) - academic research
	2. [Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis) - Used to test a scientific query
4. How to form a research question?
	1. Decide on type of study
		1. Qualitative
		2. Quantitative
		3. Mixed
	2. Understand project funding
		1. Affects choice of research question
		2. Affects when the question is formed during research process
		3. Affects how the questions is formed during research process
5. Criteria:
	1. FINER
	2. PICOT
6. How to answer a research question?
	1. It involves
		1. Observation
		2. Experimentation
			1. Literature review and consulting relevant resources:
				1. Primary sources
				2. Secondary sources
				3. Other forms of investigation

## Definition ##
1. Answer to research question solves a research problem
	1. Research question: It is the central issue to be resolved by a formal [dissertation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissertation), [thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis), or research project
2. Clearly and accurately defining the research question can be an [iterative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration) process
	1. Factors
		1. Type of research
		2. Discipline

## Constructing a Research Question ##
1. It is one of the first steps
	1. Knowledge of a subject
	2. Interest in a subject
	3. Where and what kind of info will be sought will determine the formation of research question
2. Research question must be accurately and clearly defined
	1. It makes theoretical assumptions in the framework more explicit
	2. It indicates what the researcher wants to know most and first
	3. Identify type of study before framing the research question
	4. It is iterative process if field of study or methodology do not fit 	1. Field of study
		2. Methodology
		3. Do not fit the original question
3. Methods for selecting criteria to develop research question
	1. FINER
	2. PICOT

### Construction Method Examples ###
#### FINER Criteria ####
1. The method is flexible
2. Works for many research scenarios
3. This method helps a researcher to determine whether one has the means and interest to conduct the study
4. This method also asks one to consider
	1. Ethical ramifications
	2. Relevancy
5. FINER
	1. **F** - Feasible (Does one have the means to conduct this study?)
	2. **I** - Interesting (Will this research be of interest to the audience?)
	3. **N** - Novel (Is this new research or confirming/ disproving existing findings?)
	4. **E** - Ethical (Does this study meet ethical guidelines set forth by governing bodies?)
	5. **R** - Relevant (How will this study impact current and future research?)

#### PICOT Criteria ####
1. Usually used in evidence based studies
	1. Medical studies
		1. Assessment or evaluation of patients or problems
		2. What may be the causal factor(s) with control and experimental groups
2. PICOT
	1. **P** - Patient (or Problem)
	2. **I** - Intervention (or Indicator)
	3. **C** - Comparison Group
	4. **O** - Outcomes
	5. **T** - Time
3. Investigator:
	1. Carries out the research necessary to answer research question
		1. May involve reading secondary sources over few days for an undergraduate term paper
		2. Primary research over years for major project
	2. When research is complete and researcher knows probable answer to research question
		1. Write up can begin (goes on through research project)
			1. Summary in intro in form thesis statement

### Types and Purpose ###
1. Research question serves two purposes
	1. Determines where and what kind of research the writer will be looking for
	2. Identifies specific objectives the study or paper will address

#### Qualitative Study ####
1. Seeks to learn why or how of research topic
	1. Researcher should ask why or how question about the topic
		1. How did the company successfully market its new product?
			1. Sources
				1. Print texts
				2. Internet texts (written words)
				3. Audio media
				4. Visual media
5. Example: Creswell's
	1. _______ (How or what) is the _______ ("story for" for narrative research; "meaning of" the phenomenon for phenomenology; "theory that explains the process of" for grounded theory; " culture-shaping pattern" for ethonography; "issue" in the "case" for case study) of _______ (central phenomenon) for _______ (participants) at ______ (research site).

#### Quantitative Study ####
1. Seeks to study where or when
	1. Research must be directed at determining where, or when of the research topic
		1. Writer must ask where or when about the topic
		2. Example: Where should company market its new product?
2. Mathematical analysis of research topic
	1. Research consists of numbers and statistics
3. Example: Creswell's example of script
	1. Does ________ (name the theory) explain the relationship between _______ (independent variable) and _______ (dependent variable), controlling for the effects of _______ (control variable)?
4. Example: Script for null hypothesis
	1. There is no significant difference between _______ (the control and experimental groups on the independent variable) on _______ (dependent variable)
5. Quantitative studies fall into the following categories
	1. Correlational Studies:
		1. It is non-experimental
		2. Requires writer to research relationships without manipulating or randomly selecting the subjects of research
		3. Example research question:
			1. What is the relationship between long distance commuters and eating disorders?
	2. Experimental Studies:
		1. Experiemental
		2. Requires writer to randomly select subject of research
		3. Example research question:
			1. Does consumption of fast food lead to eating disorders?

#### Mixed Study ####
1. Integrates qualitative and quantitative studies
2. Researcher should determine
	1. Why or how
	3. Where or when
3. We must craft a research question for each study required for assignment
	1. Typically between 1 and 6 questions

#### Other Criteria ####
1. Writer must consider whether research question passes "so what" test
	1. Writer must construct evidence to convince the audience why the research is expected to add new or useful knowledge to the literature
