# Golden Rules for Delegation #
1. Delegation of mundane tasks to team and then utilize the time for stratigic planning for growth and expansion

## Framework of Effective Delegation ##
1. Delegation: Learning to do business in a much better way by using OPT (Other People's Time)
2. Step 1: Identify the Tasks That Can be Delegated
	1. Identify tasks that I am handling today
	2. Amongst those tasks, which one can I give to someone else
	3. Define what Skill, Knowledge and Attitude is needed for the person who I am delegating the task to so that they can carry forward the work very well
		1. Without dropping quality
		2. Without dropping impact
			1. Do it for each one of the tasks (define ASK)
				1. We cannot delegate any task to anyone
			2. Only person with the ASK must do it
3. Step 2: Define the Role, Responsibility and Outcomes for the Person Who will Handle the Delegated Tasks
	1. Make a list of responsibilities clearly
	2. Make a list of outcomes clearly
		1. Let the person know that I will check the outcome(s) everyday
	3. Define the exact sequential task they need to perform each day
		1. Write it down
			1. For clarity (if there is no clarity, it will result in under-performance)
				1. If there is clarity, performance goes up multi-fold
	4. Give clear checking guidelines
	5. Build a culture where team brings up the problem and solves instead of BO asking if there was problem and team reacting
		1. Build an open-door policy so that the team will be open to talk about anything with ease
			1. Be very friendly to keep them in comfort zone always
4. Step 3: Build Competence in the Other Person by Training & Guidance
	1. Never Assume (Ass out of you and me)
		1. Don't assume that the person has built the competence himself
			1. Do TNA
				1. Training Need Analysis
					1. On what basis?
						1. Check how much the person is ready with ASK
							1. I build people, people build business
						2. Find out how much is missing in the team?
							1. **Do training sessions to build knowledge**
							2. **Do Practice, Simulation and Role Play to build Skills**
							3. **My conversation with them over a period of time to build the right attitude**
					2. **Then do Shadowing**
						1. **You do, they see**
						2. **Do it together**
						3. **They do, you see**
5. Step 4: Review Work & Provide Feedback
	1. Continuously review and give feedback
		1. Until they improve to satisfaction
6. If someone can replace me, I can go one step above

## Summary ##
1. Step 1: Identify what tasks can be delegated and ASK and identify persons
2. Step 2: Define role, responsibilities, outcomes for person who will handle the delegated tasks
3. Step 3: Build competence in other person by training and guidance
4. Step 4: Revew work & provide feedback
