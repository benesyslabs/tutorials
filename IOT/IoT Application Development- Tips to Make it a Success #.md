# IoT Application Development: Tips to Make it a Success #
## Introduction ##
1. Understanding necessities and stack involved in an IoT application
2. IoT: System of systems that comprises of:
	1. Physical things
	2. Communication mediums/channels
	3. Complete software solutions
		1. Includes data and operations
3. Inclusions:
	1. **Physical devices**: hardware unit with inbuilt program that regulates device mechanism and performance
	2. **Networking channels** or **communication mediums**: through which devices transmit information that follows standard protocols
	3. IoT **application development framework** which has
		1. Data analytics + incorporation abilities
		2. Integrated business logic
			1. Processes and encrypts data to validate and translate input messages sent to and received by connected device
	4. A web/mobile interface for user
	5. Database
4. Selecting proper elements to get a perfect solution

## Selecting the Perfect Device ##
1. It must be proper to facilitate movement of data back and onwards
	1. Continuous upgrade and maintenance is required
2. The following characteristics must be ensured:
	1. Higher degree of data storage and processing
	2. Better control over data attainment and mechanism control
		1. Sensors collect data in real time and translate same into digital readings for required outcomes
	3. Devices communicate with each other over defined network
		1. Expected extremely good connectivity to publish data to apps and services in cloud
	4. Need effective power management (for portable and other wearable devices)
		1. Hardware devices have ICs, microcontroller boards, computers
		2. Sensors and huge volume of data storage need to have proper set of power management
	5. Devices must function well under environmental circumstances
		1. Temperature
		2. Humidity
		3. Underwater setups
		4. Outdoor units
		5. Indoor units
		6. Altitudes
		7. ...
	6. Opt for devices certified by regulatory authorities regarded to industry

## Hand-Picking the Best Communication Channel ##
1. Need to have an understanding of the options supported by the device we selected
	1. Options:
		1. Bluetooth
		2. LAN
		3. cellular
		4. WAN
		5. Wi-Fi
		6. Satellite communication
	2. With features that facilitates seamless communication:
		1. Range
		2. Bandwidth
		3. Latency
		4. Signal strength
		5. Radio signal frequency
		6. Other security concerns

## IoT Application Development Frameworks ##
1. IoT Platform: Another name
2. [IoT Application Development](https://www.emorphis.com/internet-of-things-iot-applications-development-company-services/)
	1. Platform offerings:
		1. Ready templates
		2. in-built modules
		3. frameworks coupled with hardware mechanism so that it can quickly integrate and translate data
			1. Saves implementation time and money
3. IoT is a highly complex networking system and it needs to be automated
	1. Data plays key role in selecting IoT platform or developing a custom platform
4. Consider the following if selecting from available IoT platforms:
	1. IoT app development platform providers have hidden rates (trouble if features or requirements are not clear right from conception)
	2. Transparent about expenses need to be made, as licensing of software may cause huge finances to business
	3. Look for platform that includes hardware cost
	4. Understand crucial element of business (time or money)
		1. Huge amount may be charged for automation tools and framework which allows ready integration of data
	5. Better device management
	6. Reliable network management module
	7. Wholesome application development element
5. If clear about development strategy and functions of application, platform integration is easy
6. Step-by-Step solution for customized IoT application for the business
	1. Listener service (network program)
		1. Be able to process secured messages between devices
		2. Highly configured network solutions required
		3. Better connectivity between devices
			1. Data assimilation
	2. Data processing module: Business logic layer is built here - it processes and enables multi-user volumes
		1. User account set up
		2. Registration
		3. Access allocation
		4. Data validation
		5. Payments or other transaction processing
		6. Managing device communictions
		7. Handling errors
		8. ...
	3. Integration - strongest stage
		1. Integrating older portfolio with new solution allows seamless communication
	4. An engaging UI
		1. Must be personalized and appealing
			1. Dashboards
			2. User account panels
			3. Device management interface
			4. Better search functions
		2. Easy access to configured devices
	5. Database and data storage:
		1. Use big-data
		2. Big-data analytics is required
		3. Technology to allow flexibility, scalability, high performance
	6. Analyze and monitor IoT solution to have clarity and insight on performance
