# Working as a Freelancer With an In-House Development Team #
## Introduction ##
1. Joining a team as a freelancer
	1. Chance to apply knowledge to new challenging problem
	2. Chance to mentor junior team

## Why Do Companies with Full-Time Employees Bring on Freelancers? ##
1. Current staff not perfrect fit for existing needs

### Need Experience in a New Stack ###
1. Change in language or technology or framework - for staff to get experience with new stack
2. Freelancer helps team get up to speed with new technology
3. Company need not hire full-time employees until the technology/language/framework becomes firm direction going forward

### A Project is Behind ###
1. If project is behind deadline, freelancers augment the existing team
	1. Rarely works
		1. Affects engineering decisions
		2. Office political pressure

## Trying to Expand the Existing Team ##
1. To identify superior developers from mediocre ones
	1. freelancers are hired on "contract-to-hire" basis
	2. freelancers can decide whether they fit in the company's environment
2. Know employers needs

## Dealing With Politics ##
1. Ideas may not get accepted or contributions not welcomed if team feels threatened by your presence
2. Becoming difficult to find where I fit into the team (if hired by higher up)
	1. May get passed around with no real direction (but can be avoided if I find someone I can specially report to)
	2. Learn good soft skills
		1. Help team get direction
		2. Identify who can be asked for help
		3. Find out how I can fit into the team
3. Determine my role among them and how I can best help move project forward

## Are You "The Expert"? ##
1. Hired gun or lead?
	1. Lead: Can voice opinions and make project move in that direction
	2. Real world constraints may restrict developers from writing code they are proud of
2. Do not criticize the project in the beginning

## Who Can You Go to for Help? ##
1. Find a go to person for help on workflow, code, people, schedule
	1. Either find yourself or ask person who hired you for best resource
2. Do not waste time working on your own. Ask experienced person

## Day One on Your New Team ##
1. Paperwork, computer setup, email
2. Documentation must be in place for procedures
3. How to start?
	1. Look through ticketing system
		1. Find what types of tickets come frequently (get sense of priorities)
		2. Find what types of tickets are sitting in backlog for long time (with too much back-and-forth discussion because of complexity)
		3. Take up ticket with limited scope to experiment with code base
			1. Helps familiarize with project structure
			2. Helps familiarize with local tooling (forgot to set up)
			3. Check out documentation to ensure requisite development practices are followed

## Getting up to Speed on the Codebase ##
1. To make significant contribution, work with teammates
	1. What is the important thing being worked on?
	2. Where is much effort spent without result?
		1. Can ask supervisor
2. Pair program with teammate
	1. To find things to watch out for in current codebase
	2. Familiarize with workarounds
		1. Until rootcause is identified to fix it
3. Ask intelligent questions and get answers

## Moving Forward ##
1. Bring soft skills of getting involved with team
2. Help team accelerate project and technical skills to get immersed in codebase quickly
3. Stay in touch with former client to help out in future
