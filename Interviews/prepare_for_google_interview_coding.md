# Prepare for Your Google Interview: Coding #
## Communication and Collaboration ##
1. Understanding a problem
2. Designing a solution
3. Writing code
4. Think out loud
5. Understand how we arrived at it
6. Teams work together to solve, big and ambiguous problems
7. Tell the plan and how would you like to solve the problems
8. Ask questions
9. Underspecified problems are asked at times
	1. Open ended
	2. Dig deeper

## Algorithms and Data Structures ##
1. Code should be fast enough for users
2. Code should utilize resources efficiently
3. Strong understanding or algorithms and data structures
	1. Outline the algorithm
	2. Discuss it with the interviewer
	3. Refine and improve solution collaboratively with the interviewer
	4. Understand computational complexity of the solution
	5. We can iteratively improve the solution
	6. Use appropriate algorithms and data structures
4. Data structures to know:
	1. Arrays
	2. Linked Lists
	3. Stacks
	4. Queues
	5. Sets
	6. Maps
	7. Binary Trees
	8. Heaps
	9. Graphs
5. Which algorithm tends to go with which data structure
6. Algorithms
	1. Sorting, searching, and binary search
	2. Divide-and-conquer
	3. Dynamic programming and memoization
	4. Greedy algorithms
	5. Recursion
	6. Data structure specific algorithms
		1. Graph traversal, breadth- and depth-first
7. Obscure and domain specific algorithms are not required
8. Think of good test inputs

## Coding ##
1. Write idiomatic code in language and style we are comfortable with
2. Languages we could use:
	1. C/C++
	2. Java
	3. Python
	4. JavaScript
	5. Go
3. Evaluation is on conceptual understanding
4. Gaining fluency in one programming language is sufficient to pick up another
5. Don't worry about
	1. Memorization
	2. Syntax
	3. Punctuation

## Testing and Error Checking ##
1. Run through one or two test cases to check your work
2. Good test inputs exercise boundary conditions of the algorithm
3. Malformed inputs and how the code handles them

## Best Practices ##
1. Explain thought process during the interview
	1. Evaluation is not just technical ability but how we solve problems
2. There may be open ended questions
	1. Ask for clarification
3. Once we come up with an answer to the question, think up on a way to improve
	1. Let interviewer know what you are thinking
4. Practice writing code on paper or white board
	1. Make code easily readable
