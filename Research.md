# How to Write a Research Paper #
1. Publish findings
	1. Stay positive
		1. Hard
		2. Time consuming
		3. May need to start from scratch
	2. Choose a topic
		1. Start asking some questions
			1. How does a machine learn?
			2. What are the state of the art models in speech generation?
			3. How does the optimization process work for neural networks?
			4. Will machine learning get me a girlfriend/boyfriend? (yes)
		2. These are questions we personally want to know answers to
			1. Come up with answers to the question to satisfy yourself and teach people
				1. Posting to stackoverflow
		3. You might find an answer or you won't
			1. If not then time to research
	3. Start narrowing down
		1. What is the strategy for monte carlo tree search
		2. Be humble
		3. Niche solution to a specific problem is better for community than an ambiguous solution to a broad problem
	4. Collect data on the topic
		1. Get articles 
		2. Blog posts
		3. Tutorials
		4. PDFs
		5. Not all sources are equal
			1. Be critical assessment
				1. Who wrote it, why they wrote it, see if it is up to date
				2. .org and .edu are more reliable
				3. Knowledge gained through direct or in-direct observation
					1. Popular journals
					2. Conference submissions
					3. Social media
						1. Sub-reddit
						2. Facebook groups
					4. Google scholar
						1. Jot down some of the sources
						2. We can use them
	5. Find cozy spot to feel comfortable
	6. Take different sources and put them together in a way no one has thought of before
		1. Single day to several weeks
		2. From this synthesis of data, we can come to some kind of belief
		3. Some kind of possible solution that you think might work for the problem
		4. Thesis: Declaration of my belief based on the data
			1. Paper should be about defending the belief using compelling arguments based on my own results as well as based on results of others
			2. Thesis may not be finalized, it may change as we develop our ideas
			3. Don't waste time on researching something that is not a good idea
	7. Ask for validation of the thesis from people well versed in the topic
		1. If it is not a good idea don't waste time
	8. Email paper authors directly or ask them on social media platforms
	9. Then go ahead and solve the problem
	10. Have something super basic in place that solves the problem first
	11. Then work on the functional baseline (creativity)
	12. Start writing outline
		1. Look at theses and the subsections listed
		2. Note the subsections that are generalized from the related papers
		3. Think of specific subsections which we may need to add or remove
		4. Format:
			1. Summary
			2. Abstract
			3. Introduction:
				1. Motivations
				2. Background data
			4. Methodology:
				1. Documents research process
			5. Results 
			6. Duscussion: Weighing all the results
			7. Conclusion: Used to answer the thesis
			8. References: Sites sources
	13. Write the first draft:
		1. Art of technical writing: Informative, engaging and educating way
		2. Don't try to sound smart
			1. Get the point across as efficiently as possible
			2. Using language that reader understands
		3. Go into excruciating detail explaining every bit of work
			1. It is easier to cut down a long paper than to increase it in size
			2. 5 - 10 pages
		4. Support every statement with reference
		5. Never plagiarize
		6. It must have the synthesis of ideas we have learnt
		7. It is better to show than tell
			1. Use tools
				1. Omni graphl
				2. Ink scape
		8. All sections must be interconnected
			1. Title Page - 1 page
			2. Abstract - 1 page
			3. Introduction - 1 page
			4. Review & Discussion - 1-3 pages
			5. Conclusion - 1 page
			6. Appendix - 1-5 pages
			7. References - 1-2 pages
		9. Don't spend too much time
	14. Revise:
		1. Check for grammar errors and misspelled words
		2. Factual errors
		3. Are numbers correct
		4. Re-arranging ideas (one section should come after another)
	15. Add optional content:
		1. Table of contents
		2. Appendix 
	16. Submit to a popular journal
		1. Nature
		2. R/Machinelearning
		3. github.com
	17. Top journals ask other scientists to validate
		1. Gives technical authority to the paper
