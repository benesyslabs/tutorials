# Behave Pro #

Behave Pro offers seamless and secure integration between GitHub and Jira, enabling all members of the software team to collaborate on user stories.

* User story conversations and scenarios are captured in Jira
* Changes to scenarios in Jira automatically publish to BDD feature files in GitHub, so the code always has up-to-date feature files alongside
* Changes committed to feature files and pushed to GitHub sync straight back to Jira
* Automated acceptance tests can then be run with Cucumber, SpecFlow, Behat and Behave

Agile teams practicing behaviour driven development (BDD) can use the Behave Pro collaboration hub - native to Jira and synced to GitHub - as the single source of truth for their projects, helping them regain time and avoid costly rework.
