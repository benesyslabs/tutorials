## IELTS Reading Strategies: True, False, Not Given ##
1. True or T: (one of the most difficult)
	1. Tips:
		1. Long passage
			1. Cyber crime
			2. Food security
			3. History of the Internet
			4. ...
		2. Some statements (facts)
			1. Say it is T, F, or not given
		3. Yes/No/Not Given - Involves writer's opinion
		4. T:
			1. Fact is clearly written (in the reading)
			2. Synomyms
			3. Write T only if you see it written (if the fact is true but not written, then don't write T)
				1. Only if it is given in the reading
	2. Passage:
	
			This increase in cyber crime has alarmed many experts...
			
		1. Statements:
			1. Cyber crime is on the rise
				1. Underline keywords: cyber crime, rise
				2. Quickly scan the passage
				3. Look for the keywords or their synonyms (different words that mean the same thing)
					1. Increase
					2. Cyber crime
				4. Read that sentence in passage very carefully to check if matches the statement or if it contradicts the statement
		2. Look for following words in general: (be careful with them)
			1. Some
			2. All
			3. Only
			4. Never
			5. Usually
			6. Often
			7. Sometimes
			8. ...
2. False or F: Fact is opposite
	1. Look for words:
		1. All vs Some
		2. Always vs Often
	2. Example:
		1. The first personal computer was invented in the 1970s
			1. Personal computers were first invented in 1990
3. Not Given or NG - If fact is not written, if we do not see the total opposite, not written (finding difference between false and not given is hard)
	1. Example: Although once eradicated from Toronto, _bed bugs_ have made a comeback and now considered _one of_ the _leading pests_ in the city
		1. Rats are the most common nuisance Torontonians face.
			1. Rats
			2. Most common 
			3. Nuisance
			3. Torontonians
	2. Points:
		1. If we don't see it (if it is a fact), the answer is NG
		2. Don't spend too much time on each fact
			1. Don't keep searching the passage (it might not be there)
				1. Put a star and move on to the next question and come back
		3. Look of sentence in the passage that might invalidate the fact (says exactly opposite)
			1. This makes it F instead of NG
