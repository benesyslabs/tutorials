# Java vs Kotlin for Android Development #
## Introduction ##
1. A comparative study of two languages
2. Facts about Android and Java
	1. Android: Open source mobile OS
		1. Based on Linux Kernel written in C
			1. Drivers are written in C/C++
			2. Android is written in C/C++
	2. Java is preferred because it is easier to learn and code
3. In Android, bytecode gets executed in VM built in it
	1. Java is object oriented
	2. Robust
	3. Secure
	4. Portable
	5. High performance
4. Kotlin
	1. Developed by JetBrains
	2. Runs on JVM
	3. Statically typed
		1. Requires declaration of data types before we use them
	4. Official programming language for Android

## Easy to Code ##
1. Limitations in functions and features in Java have been resolved in Kotlin immensely
2. Concise language
	1. In-built functions execute block of code
	2. Improves developer productivity
3. Looks neat and hence easy to maintain and read, effective and efficient
4. Including new feature in Java is cumbersome because old features have to be supported
5. Java is more complex as compared to Kotlin

## Speed ##
1. Java compilation may be 2% faster
	1. Only for full builds
	2. But if new features and functions in Kotlin are understood and used appropriately, Kotlin is a booster

## Exception Handling ##
1. Null Pointer Exception (NPE)
	1. Debugging can kill time in Java
	2. Java is almost statically typed language
		1. Variable of type String may not refer to a String (can be null)
		2. Not safe
2. Kotlin differentiates between non-null types and nullable types
	1. Types are non-null by default
	2. Can be made nullable if need be

## Memory Usage ##
1. Same garbage collection feature in both
	1. 100% compatible with Java libraries
	2. Objects in both occupy the same space
2. Clean up works the same way

## Full Java Interoperability ##
1. Kotlin classes can inherit from Java classes, implement Java interfaces, call Java methods, ...
2. Java code can inherit from Kotlin classes, implement Kotlin interfaces, and call Kotlin methods
3. Java app can be readily migrated to a Kotlin application
	1. With fewer lines of code
4. Other features in Kotlin
	1. Extension function
	2. Lazy loading
	3. Inline functions
	4. Receiver functions
	5. ...

## Support ##
1. Resources with skill are scarce
	1. Hands-on support to resolve bugs is not as easily available in Kotlin as for Java

## Cost Saving ##
1. Less code implies fewer bugs and lesser coding time
	1. Cost saving as compared to Java
2. Kotlin is an enhancement to Java and not a replacement
	1. Investing time in learning Kotlin is worth the effort
	2. Kotlin has all the features that Java has and much more
